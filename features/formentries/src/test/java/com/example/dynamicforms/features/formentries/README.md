# FormEntriesViewModel Tests

This document outlines the test coverage for the `FormEntriesViewModel` class and suggests potential improvements.

## Current Test Coverage

The `FormEntriesViewModelTest` class provides comprehensive test coverage for the `FormEntriesViewModel`, including:

1. **Loading Form and Entries**
   - Successful loading of form and entries
   - Handling null form
   - Handling empty entries
   - Error handling when use case throws exception

2. **Retry Functionality**
   - Retry with previous form ID
   - Retry without previous form ID

3. **Navigation Events**
   - AddNewEntry event
   - NavigateToFormDetail event

4. **Delete Functionality**
   - ShowDeleteDialog event
   - DeleteEntry event (successful deletion)
   - DeleteEntry event (failed deletion)
   - DismissDeleteDialog event

5. **UI State Properties**
   - Entry classification (submitted vs. draft)
   - Computed properties (isEmpty, hasError, totalEntries)

## Potential Improvements

While the current test coverage is comprehensive, here are some potential improvements:

1. **Edge Cases**
   - Test with very large numbers of entries to ensure performance
   - Test with entries that have unusual or edge-case data
   - Test with concurrent operations (e.g., deleting an entry while loading)

2. **Error Handling**
   - More specific error cases for DeleteFormEntryUseCase
   - Test network timeouts or other specific error conditions
   - Test recovery from errors

3. **State Transitions**
   - Test more complex sequences of events (e.g., load, delete, retry)
   - Test state transitions during loading (e.g., cancellation)

4. **Mocking Improvements**
   - Use mockito-kotlin consistently throughout the tests
   - Consider using a test coroutine dispatcher for more control over timing

5. **Test Organization**
   - Group related tests into nested classes for better organization
   - Add more descriptive test names

## Implementation Notes

- The tests use Mockito for mocking dependencies
- The tests use the MainDispatcherRule to handle coroutines in tests
- The tests follow the Given-When-Then pattern for clarity
